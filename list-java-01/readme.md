# Welcome to Learning Java Programming Language

This is a simple example of a Java code that prints "Hello World" on the screen. The code contains a class called `helloworld` which contains the `main` method. The `main` method is the entry point of the program and is where the actual action takes place.

The `helloworld` class creates a String object called `name` and assigns the value "Hello World" to it. The `System.out.println` method is used to print the contents of the `name` variable on the screen.

To run this code, you will need to have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer and configure the project settings in Visual Studio Code. Be sure to follow the steps described in the previous question to properly set up the development environment.

This code is just a basic example of what is possible with the Java language and is a great way to start learning how to program. From here, you can explore more about flow control structures, classes and objects, inheritance and much more.
