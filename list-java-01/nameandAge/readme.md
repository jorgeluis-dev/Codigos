#Java Input and Output

This is a basic Java program that prompts the user for their name, age and email and then displays the input in a message dialog box.

##Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A Java IDE (e.g. Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)

##Usage
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Run the program by clicking the run button or by using the command line.

##How to run the code
1. Compile the code using the command line: javac nameandAge.java
2. Run the code using the command line: java nameandAge

##How it works
- The program uses the JOptionPane class to display input dialogs and message dialogs to the user.
- The user is prompted to enter their name, age and email.
- The input is then stored in variables and displayed in a message dialog along with a message.
- The program does not handle the possibility of the user canceling the input dialogs or entering an invalid value. It would be a good idea to add some validation and error handling to make sure the user enters valid input.

##Improvements
- The program could be improved by adding validation and error handling to ensure the user enters valid input.
- The program could also be improved by storing the user's input in a file or database for later use.
