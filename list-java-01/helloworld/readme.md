# Welcome to Learning Java Programming Language

This is a simple example of a Java code that prints "Hello World" on the screen. The code contains a class called `helloworld` which contains the `main` method. The `main` method is the entry point of the program and is where the actual action takes place.

The `helloworld` class creates a String object called `name` and assigns the value "Hello World" to it. The `System.out.println` method is used to print the contents of the `name` variable on the screen.

To run this code, you will need to have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer and configure the project settings in Visual Studio Code. Be sure to follow the steps described in the previous question to properly set up the development environment.

This code is just a basic example of what is possible with the Java language and is a great way to start learning how to program. From here, you can explore more about flow control structures, classes and objects, inheritance and much more.

# Running the Code from the Terminal

In addition to running the code from within Visual Studio Code, you can also run the code from the terminal. To do this, you will need to have the JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your computer and the path to the JDK set in your system's environment variables.

1.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the `helloworld.java` file is located.
    
2.  Compile the code by typing the following command:
    

Copy code

`javac helloworld.java` 

This command will create a new file called `helloworld.class`

3.  Run the code by typing the following command:

Copy code

`java helloworld` 

This command will execute the `main` method in the `helloworld` class and print "Hello World" on the screen.

Note: If you are using an IDE, like Eclipse or IntelliJ, it will handle all the steps above and you only need to press the run button.

Be sure to check your JDK version and the path to it, specially if you are facing any issues on running the code.
